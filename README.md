# 📊 Google Search Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **Google Search Trend Analysis** using Python.
It helps analyze how a keyword performs across countries, over time, and in comparison with related keywords.

The objective is to simulate a real-world **data-driven job role task** where we:

1. Search multiple keywords dynamically
2. Identify top countries searching the keyword
3. Visualize results using charts
4. Plot a world map of interest
5. Analyze time-wise trends
6. Compare related keywords

## 🎯 Project Objectives

### 1️⃣ Dynamic Keyword Search

The system is designed so that by changing only the keyword variable, the analysis updates automatically. This allows easy exploration of multiple topics without modifying the full workflow.

---

### 2️⃣ Top 15 Countries Analysis

* Extract country-wise interest data
* Identify top 15 countries where the keyword is most searched
* Display results in:

  * Bar chart
  * Table format

This helps understand geographical demand.

### 3️⃣ World Map Visualization

A choropleth world map is generated showing:

* Countries colored based on search interest
* Higher intensity color = higher search volume
* Visual global comparison

This gives quick visual insight into global trends.

---

### 4️⃣ Time-wise Interest Analysis

The project extracts historical trend data to analyze:

* Monthly or yearly search trends
* Growth or decline patterns
* Seasonal spikes

A line chart is generated to show how interest changed over years.

---

### 5️⃣ Related Keywords Comparison

* Extract related search queries
* Compare multiple keywords together
* Plot comparison graph

This helps in:

* Market research
* SEO analysis
* Content strategy planning
